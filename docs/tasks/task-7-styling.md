# Task 7: Styling

## Objective
Establish global styles and ensure responsive, clean design across all blocks.

## Requirements
- Suggest global styles (colors, typography, spacing) - all should match www.pearson.com
- Make layout responsive
- Keep CSS clean and reusable
- Follow brand guidelines if available

## Constraints
- Use modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- Mobile-first approach
- No CSS frameworks (no Tailwind, etc.)
- Follow EDS styling conventions

## Dependencies
- Task 4 (Code Generation) should be in progress or complete

## Deliverables
- [ ] Global styles (styles/styles.css)
- [ ] Typography system
- [ ] Color palette
- [ ] Spacing system
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Lazy styles (styles/lazy-styles.css)
- [ ] Font definitions (styles/fonts.css)

## Status
Completed

## Notes
All Pearson brand colors, typography, spacing, and design tokens have been implemented in styles.css and lazy-styles.css. Blocks styled with Pearson brand identity.

## Notes
Global styles should be minimal. Most styling should be scoped to blocks.
