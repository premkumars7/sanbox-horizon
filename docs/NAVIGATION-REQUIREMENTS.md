# Navigation Requirements - homepage.png Layout

## What We Need from You

To implement the header correctly, please describe what you see in **homepage.png** in the header section:

### Please tell us:

1. **Top Bar** (if exists):
   - What text/links do you see?
   - Is there a utility bar above the main nav?
   - Example items you mentioned: "bycustomer", "Educatunion" - where are these?

2. **Main Navigation** (the dark blue bar):
   - **Left side**: Logo text? Logo image?
   - **Center/Middle**: What navigation links? (Home, Products, Solutions, Support? Or different items?)
   - **Right side**: What buttons/icons do you see?
     - Search icon?
     - Cart icon?
     - Buttons?

3. **Specific Items You Mentioned**:
   - "log" - Is this the Pearson logo? Or a "Login" link?
   - "bycustomer" - Is this a menu item? Part of a dropdown?
   - "Educatunion" - What does this say exactly in the image?

## Current Understanding

Based on Pearson.com (for CSS reference):
- **Top bar**: FOR SCHOOL | FOR COLLEGE | FOR WORK | EXPLORE PEARSON
- **Main nav**: Logo | Search | Cart | Support | Sign in

But we need to know what **homepage.png actually shows** for the layout structure!

## Action Items

Once you describe the navigation in homepage.png:
1. ✅ Update /nav content structure in da.live
2. ✅ Implement utility bar (if needed)
3. ✅ Add icons (search, cart)
4. ✅ Style with Pearson.com CSS
5. ✅ Match exact layout from design
